### Access Requirements

!!! warning "Developer Note - Remove Me!"
    What external systems (if any) it needs access to in order to work.

## Install Guide

!!! note
    Apps can be installed from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) or locally. See the [Nautobot documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/user-guide/administration/installation/app-install/) for more details. The pip package name for this app is [`nautobot-app-power-plant`](https://pypi.org/project/nautobot-app-power-plant/).

The app is available as a Python package via PyPI and can be installed with `pip`:

```shell
pip install nautobot-app-power-plant
```

To ensure Nautobot App Power Plant is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, create a file named `local_requirements.txt` (if not already existing) in the Nautobot root directory (alongside `requirements.txt`) and list the `nautobot-app-power-plant` package:

```shell
echo nautobot-app-power-plant >> local_requirements.txt
```

Once installed, the app needs to be enabled in your Nautobot configuration. The following block of code below shows the additional configuration required to be added to your `nautobot_config.py` file:

- Append `"nautobot_app_power_plant"` to the `PLUGINS` list.
- Append the `"nautobot_app_power_plant"` dictionary to the `PLUGINS_CONFIG` dictionary and override any defaults.

```python
# In your nautobot_config.py
PLUGINS = ["nautobot_app_power_plant"]

# PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
#   "nautobot_app_power_plant": {
#     ADD YOUR SETTINGS HERE
#   }
# }
```

Once the Nautobot configuration is updated, run the Post Upgrade command (`nautobot-server post_upgrade`) to run migrations and clear any cache:

```shell
nautobot-server post_upgrade
```

Then restart (if necessary) the Nautobot services which may include:

- Nautobot
- Nautobot Workers
- Nautobot Scheduler

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nautobot nautobot-worker nautobot-scheduler
```
